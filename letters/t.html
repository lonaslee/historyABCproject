            Tombs are where the ancient Egyptian pharaohs (god king) were buried when they died. It was believed that
            the pharaoh could pass on to the afterlife, and their tombs were lined with possessions that they could take
            with them. These elaborate palace tombs were placed inside a pyramid, an even bigger construction project.
