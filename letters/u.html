            He is an immortal man in the Epic of Gilgamesh who was tasked by the gods with the construction of a huge
            ship to preserve every species from a coming flood. <a href="g.html">Gilgamesh</a> embarks on a journey to
            search for Utnapishtim to ask how to overcome death, and he tells Gilgamesh to give up, as death was created
            to accompany life by the gods.
