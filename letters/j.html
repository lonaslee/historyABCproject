            It is a semi-precious stone that can only be found in some places of the world. In ancient Mesoamerica, it
            was an important resource that was used for art and ceremonies, as many artifacts show. Jade is not actually
            available in the areas where these artifacts are found, suggesting that they were obtained from traders.
